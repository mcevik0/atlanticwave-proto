class L2MultipointPolicy(UserPolicy):
    ''' This policy is for network administrators to create L2 multipoint LANs, 
        similar to MetroEthernet's E-LAN

        It requires the following information to create a tunnel:
          - Start time
          - End time
          - List of switch-port-vlan dictionaries
          - Maximum Bandwidth on a given link

        Example Json:
        {"L2Multipoint":{
            "starttime":"1985-04-12T23:20:50",
            "endtime":"1985-04-12T23:20:50+0400",
            "endpoints": [ {"switch":"mia-switch", "port":5, "vlan":286},
                           {"switch":"atl-switch", "port":3, "vlan":1856},
                           {"switch":"gru-switch", "port":4, "vlan":3332} ],
            "bandwidth":1000}}
        Times are RFC3339 formated offset from UTC, if any, is after the seconds
        Bandwidth is in Mbit/sec

        Side effect of coming from JSON, everything's unicode. Need to handle 
        parsing things into the appropriate types (int, for instance).
