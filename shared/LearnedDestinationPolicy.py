class LearnedDestinationPolicy(UserPolicy):
    ''' This policy is for a distributed learning switch model. Traditional 
        OpenFlow learning switches involve a surprising amount of forwarding to
        the controller. At 100Gbps, this is simply too much. As such, we've 
        created a learning switch model that minimizes the amount of traffic 
        forwarded. Part of this is to create paths between endpoints easily.

        LearnedDestinationPolicy is the mechanism for when there is a known path
        and this will represent the connection between two given endpoints.

        It requires the following information to create a learned destination:
          - Dst Switch
          - Dst Port 
          - Dst Address

        Example Json:
        {"LearnedDestination":{
            "dstswitch":"mia-switch",
            "dstport":7,
            "dstaddress":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"}}

        Dst Address is the destination address. Currently, using MAC address, but
        could be changed to use an IP address.        

        Side effect of coming from JSON, everything's unicode. Need to handle 
        parsing things into the appropriate types (int, for instance).

            To break down this policy, we need to install rules into all

            paths. To do this, we'll need to get a list of all switches, and 
            then start creating paths. As we create paths, they will also cover 
            *other* switches, so we won't have to actually go through the 
            process for those other switches of determing shortest paths and 
            creating duplicate rules.

                - for each node along path,

                      is on the list, skip
                    - else, create and add rule to list of rules, and add switch
